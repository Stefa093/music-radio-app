The website is going to take you to the Login section, if you have an account you need to enter your information and then you can purchase an album from
the store but if you don't have an account in this case you need to go to Sign Up section and crate a new account by this way you can have full
access to the store.
If you need to create a new account there are some rules that you need to follow as for example your name can't contain numbers, the good thing is 
that the form is not going to let you pass until all the fields are completed and you have a helpfull sugestion on how you need to enter your information.
